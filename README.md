# Dungeons and Dragons CLI
Flatiron Portfolio Project - CLI on Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition 

This project helps users create a Dungeons and Dragons character by providing characteristics and data on each of the
D&D races. The CLI will provide a list of races, ask the user to choose a race, and provide details and stats on the selection.    

Dungeons and Dragons can be intimidating to first time players. I hope this project will give them enough knowledge to succeed in 
creating their desired character.
